My Notebook of DataCamp Projects. 4 projects included.

<b>Google Play Store Data Analysis</b><br>
--------------------------------------
Scraped Google Play Store data loaded, cleaned and visualized to gain insight into the Android app market. Performed data wrangling, create visualizations, and carry out a descriptive and inferential analysis on Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.
*You can find the dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates , too.

<b>Manipulating and Visualizing Historical Data</b><br>
--------------------------------------------------
Manipulated and visualized Noble Foundation data to explore the patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. Python libraries including pandas, Numpy, seaborn and matplotlib used to alter and picturise the data.

<b>Movie and TV Data Manipulation and Visualization</b><br>
-------------------------------------
Analysed Netflix's movies data to find if its length are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using python skills from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

<b>Predicting Credit Card Approval</b><br>
----------------------------
Developed a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved. Handled the missing values, pre-processed the data and fit the data to the logistic regression model to train the dataset. Made predictions and evaluated the model performance to find out the best performing model which predicts credit card approval.
